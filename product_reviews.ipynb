    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Help a leading mobile brand understand the voice of the customer by analyzing the reviews of their product on Amazon and the topics that customers are talking about. You will perform topic modeling on specific parts of speech. You'll finally interpret the emerging topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Statement:**\n",
    "A popular mobile phone brand, Lenovo has launched their budget smartphone in the Indian market. The client wants to understand the VOC (voice of the customer) on the product. This will be useful to not just evaluate the current product, but to also get some direction for developing the product pipeline. The client is particularly interested in the different aspects that customers care about. Product reviews by customers on a leading e-commerce site should provide a good view.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Domain:** Amazon reviews for a leading phone brand\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis to be done:** POS tagging, topic modeling using LDA, and topic interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Content:**\n",
    "- Dataset: ‘K8 Reviews v0.2.csv’\n",
    "- Columns:\n",
    "    - Sentiment: The sentiment against the review (4,5 star reviews are positive, 1,2 are negative)\n",
    "    - Reviews: The main text of the review\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps to perform:**\n",
    "- Discover the topics in the reviews and present it to business in a consumable format. Employ techniques in syntactic processing and topic modeling.\n",
    "- Perform specific cleanup, POS tagging, and restricting to relevant POS tags, then, perform topic modeling using LDA. Finally, give business-friendly names to the topics and make a table for business.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks:**\n",
    "1. Read the .csv file using Pandas. Take a look at the top few records.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Normalize casings for the review text and extract the text into a list for easier manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Tokenize the reviews using NLTKs word_tokenize function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Perform parts-of-speech tagging on each sentence using the NLTK POS tagger.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. For the topic model, we should  want to include only nouns.\n",
    "    1. Find out all the POS tags that correspond to nouns.\n",
    "    2. Limit the data to only terms with these tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Lemmatize. \n",
    "    1. Different forms of the terms need to be treated as one.\n",
    "    2. No need to provide POS tag to lemmatizer for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Remove stopwords and punctuation (if there are any). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Create a topic model using LDA on the cleaned-up data with 12 topics.\n",
    "    1. Print out the top terms for each topic.\n",
    "    2. What is the coherence of the model with the c_v metric?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Analyze the topics through the business lens.\n",
    "    1. Determine which of the topics can be combined.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Create topic model using LDA with what you think is the optimal number of topics\n",
    "    1. What is the coherence of the model?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. The business should  be able to interpret the topics.\n",
    "    1. Name each of the identified topics.\n",
    "    2. Create a table with the topic name and the top 10 terms in each to present to the  business."

(yet to enter two sim card & use whatsapp , gmail , so if it continues to become more worst i'd surely update & escalate this )2),camera quality(for a dual camera , it is nowhere near honor 6x which is 1k lesser) .if you are tricked by the dual camera ( it still has not got update of slowmo , time lapse ) but it is really good when taken in professional mode with manual iso & focussing.a disaster in auto mode , that too for a rear camera with dual lens .i wish the company wakes up and starts rolling out ota update for camera & battery life improvement.other than that , the phone is super smooth , display , touch , finger print sensor & stock android is a bit of self satisfaction that i can say to myself for wasting 14k .i thought of gifting it to my father , but this would make it surely an incomplete gift .!wish the company looks into these issues & provides updates for the camera & battery life because that is what it was paid for & marketed by the company claiming those 2 are the highlight factors.lost interest to even post pictures of it.with much regret.\",\n",
